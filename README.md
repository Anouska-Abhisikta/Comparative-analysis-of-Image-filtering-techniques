# Comparative-analysis-of-Image-filtering-techniques
This project deals in surveying over different filtering techniques for static images used for image recognition . The filtering methods were evaluated on the MNIST dataset, which included 60,000 handwritten digit pictures for testing and 10,000 for training. We have demonstrated each mean filtering, median filtering, Laplaceâ€™s filtering, Gaussian Filtering, Canny Edge filtering, Spatial filtering,  Normalized Box Blur filtering, Quadratic Image filtering and Bilateral Image filtering by displaying a sample image before and after training the model and have calculated the accuracy for each filtering method . At the very end, we have performed an analysis by comparing these methods based on their accuracy thus yielding us the best filtering technique for static images.
